/**
 * Read something at most once per request.
 *
 * A single render asks the same questions repeatedly: the route middleware,
 * the SSR context loader and each of the page's own loaders all resolve the
 * same site and the same membership, and each resolution is a D1 round trip
 * that is the dominant cost of a CMS request. None of those answers can change
 * while the request is in flight, so the second and later asks are pure
 * latency.
 *
 * `event.context` is H3's per-request store and is already how this codebase
 * carries request-scoped values (tenantType, organizationId, publicResourceProvider).
 * The promise is stored, not the resolved value, so concurrent callers in the
 * same `Promise.all` share one round trip rather than racing to start two.
 *
 * Only cache reads that are stable for the life of the request. A rejected
 * read is dropped so a retry is not served the failure, and a caller that
 * needs to observe a write it just made must not read through here.
