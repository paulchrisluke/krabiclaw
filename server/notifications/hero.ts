/**
 * The picture a surface leads with for an owner: a notification's hero, an
 * agenda row, a booking's detail. `resolveOwnerPicture` decides it; this reads
 * the placements it needs. An experience booking leads with the experience and
 * a table reservation with its location, because that is what the guest is
 * looking at.
 *
 * Null is a first-class answer: nothing is substituted, and no stock or
 * placeholder image is invented — tenant surfaces render the tenant's own
 * content or none.
