/**
 * Meta's data-deletion callback.
 *
 * It erases what Krabiclaw holds about one verified Meta person in one Meta
 * app: the publication receipts naming them and their linked account, even
 * after the connection is gone. The tenant's own posts, including ones
 * published to that Page, stay; only their link to it goes.
 *
 * It deletes Meta's data, not the customer. A Krabiclaw workspace is deleted
 * by its owner through Better Auth's organization deletion; a request from
 * Meta about one person's Instagram account is not that, and must never
 * become that.
 *
 * The confirmation code is a JWT Better Auth signs with its own secret, naming
 * the verified app and subject, so the status URL re-checks the real remaining
 * state and cannot be pointed at another person. A cleanup
 * that fails answers 500, and Meta's retry resumes it.
