// GET /api/public/blog?collection=blog|docs — the requesting tenant's published articles
//
// This was two routes. `/api/public/blog` served Krabiclaw's own articles
// through `listPublicPlatformBlogPosts`, which was `listBlogPosts` with the
// platform site looked up and hardcoded; `/api/public/blog`
// served everyone else's from a near-identical query. The platform is an
// ordinary tenant, so that was one concept with two implementations, and the
// tenant half took its site id from the URL instead of from the host that had
// already identified it.
//
// One route now. The tenant comes from `event.context.organizationId`, which
// tenant-resolution sets from the host, so krabiclaw.com gets Krabiclaw's
// articles and a tenant domain gets that tenant's, by the same code.
