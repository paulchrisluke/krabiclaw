// The Durable Object as its own Worker, for `nuxt dev` only.
//
// Wrangler's platform proxy cannot host a Durable Object whose class lives in
// the Worker being proxied: it runs an empty script, so the production binding
// (class in this Worker, no script_name) resolves to nothing and every
// broadcast failed with 500 under `yarn dev`. Wrangler's answer is a separate
// Worker for the class, started with `wrangler dev` and reached through the
// local dev registry by `script_name`. server/plugins/00.cloudflare-dev-bindings.ts
// starts this one; `[env.dev]` in wrangler.toml binds to it. The built Worker
// (`yarn dev:worker`, staging, production) exports the same class itself
// through exports.cloudflare.ts and never uses this file.
