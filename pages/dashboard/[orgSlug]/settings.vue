    Menu: the business's own page, a tab root. Its rows are the site's lists
    and settings, each a level below.

    Search and the bell hang off it: the dashboard has one search and this is
    where it lives.

    The account is a row in the list below, not a control up here. Measured on
    Airbnb at 390 (2026-09-22): their `/hosting` draws no header and no avatar
    at all on a phone, and the account is reached as "Account settings" in the
    Menu tab's own list. The header carries the avatar from `md` up, where
    Airbnb's does too.
