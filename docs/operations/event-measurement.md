# Event measurement

One tenant-scoped event contract measures every pageview, interaction and
business outcome, whatever the theme or entry surface. The native D1 store
(`analytics_events`, `analytics_summaries`) is canonical. The MCP tool
`query_organization_analytics` is the canonical access contract: the dashboard
route `/api/dashboard/analytics-query` and CMS Insights call the same
authorized implementation (`server/utils/analytics-query.ts`), and the summary
report (`server/utils/analytics-report.ts`, MCP `get_organization_analytics`) is
built on the same events. Google Analytics 4 is an optional destination for the
same facts; native records never depend on it, on consent to it, or on its
delivery succeeding. No surface collects credentials, card data, tokens,
free-text form content or error messages, and none accepts arbitrary SQL.

## The catalog

`utils/organization-conversion-events.ts` is the only catalog: producer, allowed
stages, subject entity, value semantics, conversion type, GA4 projection and the
one GA4 sender for each event. The writer
(`server/utils/organization-conversions.ts`) enforces it; the schema
(`analytics_events_shape_check`, `analytics_events_conversion_entity_unique`)
enforces the shape and the once-per-subject rule.

| Native event | Subject (entity) | Counted | GA4 event | GA4 sender |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sign_up` | user | once per registered user (`databaseHooks.user.create.after`; anonymous guests, login, provider linking and existing-user invitation acceptance never reach it) | `sign_up` | Measurement Protocol |
| `onboarding_complete` | organization | once per organization, when `activateOrganization` commits `onboarding_status = 'active'` | `tutorial_complete` | Measurement Protocol |
| `contact_submit` | request | persisted enquiry | `generate_lead`, `conversion_type=contact` | browser (Zaraz web API) |
| `reservation_submit` | request | persisted reservation | `reservation_submit`, `conversion_type=reservation` | browser |
| `booking_submit` | request | persisted booking, with its quoted value | `booking_submit`, `conversion_type=booking` | browser |
| `purchase` | invoice | Stripe `invoice.paid` with a positive amount | `purchase` | Measurement Protocol |
| `refund` | refund | Stripe refund with status `succeeded` | `refund` | Measurement Protocol |
| `consultation_cta_click`, `product_order_external_click`, `link_click`, `donation_click` | handoffs | every click; a handoff is not a booking, payment or donation | same name | browser |

### Interactions and their producers

Every browser-emitted fact is an `interaction` event with a stable UUID chosen
by its producer: the same ID delivered twice is one event, two views of a
product are two events. `POST /api/analytics/interactions` (public origin) and
`POST /api/public/conversion-events` (product views and booking starts) are the
only browser entrances; both write through
`recordOrganizationConversionEvent`. Google Analytics is only ever a projection of a
recorded native event: the browser sends the Zaraz copy after the native
endpoint accepted the event, with the native event UUID as GA `event_id`, and
only when consent allows. A rejected or failed native write sends nothing to
GA. For a server-owned submission (contact, reservation, booking) the response
carries `measurement` (`{status: "recorded", event_id}` or
`{status: "failed", reason}`) beside the committed result; the browser mirrors
to GA only for `recorded`, and the submission is successful either way. The
booking quote is resolved inside that measurement, so an unresolvable quote is a
measurement failure, never a reason the booking was not made. One consequence:
a click that navigates away before the native response arrives has its native
event (delivered with keepalive) but no GA copy.

| Interaction | Canonical producer | GA4 name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `product_view`, `checkout_start` | `ProductDetailPage.vue` via `useOrganizationConversionTracking` | `view_item`, `begin_checkout` |
| `consultation_cta_click`, `product_order_external_click`, `link_click`, `donation_click` | `useOrganizationConversionTracking` | same name |
| `organization_created`, `domain_connected`, `subscription_upgrade`, `subscription_downgrade`, `subscription_checkout_success`, `post_created`, `post_published`, `image_uploaded`, `video_uploaded`, `media_library_viewed`, `dashboard_visited`, `error_encountered` | `useAnalytics` (measured on the platform organization; subject is the organization worked on, actor is the user; only the catalog's allowlisted scalar `properties` are kept) | same name |

Server-owned outcomes (`sign_up`, `onboarding_complete`, submissions, payments,
refunds) are never emitted by the browser.

Exactly one sender owns each outcome. Never send the application name and the GA4
name for the same fact.

## Measuring organization

The measuring organization is the business whose outcome is measured. KrabiClaw's
acquisition events (`sign_up`, `onboarding_complete`, `purchase`, `refund`) are
recorded on the platform organization (`getPlatformOrganization`); the subscribing
organization is the subject (`entity_id`, `metadata.subscribing_organization_id`).
Customer booking, reservation and contact events are recorded on the customer's
own organization. Subscription revenue therefore never appears in a customer's
report, and a customer's outcomes never fall back to KrabiClaw.

## Collection contract

The client collector (`utils/pageview-tracking-runtime.client.ts`) registers
independently of the initial route and captures each navigation's payload
(path, query attribution, referrer, locale, event ID, occurrence time) when the
navigation is observed. Duration is reported for the exact event. Delivery
failures are reported through the application's error mechanism, not swallowed.

`server/api/analytics/track.post.ts` resolves the path with
`resolvePublicPageIdentity`: a prefixed route (`/th/pricing`) yields the public
path, the locale `th`, and the lookup path `/pricing`, validated by the same
resolver the public site serves (published locale, entitlement, published
representation). Unknown, unpublished or other-tenant routes are rejected;
paths are never rewritten to make a lookup succeed. Each pageview stores its own
observations (`observed`: the UTMs, click IDs and referrer it carried, partial
inputs kept), the attribution in force for it when it happened
(`attribution` + `attribution_basis`: `own_touch`, `inherited`, `none`),
the page, locale, document/product and location, session and visitor.
The session's last touch is a derived view and never rewrites an event. A
repeated event ID changes nothing. `occurred_at` is the browser-reported time
bounded by receipt; `received_at` is the server watermark.

Outcomes and interactions reference the pageview they happened on
(`origin_event_id`). The browser captures an interaction (ID, moment, page)
when it happens and only its delivery waits for that pageview to be recorded
(`pageEventIdFor`); the collector registers independently of the emitters, so
an emitter that runs first (a product page on mount) waits on the collector
rather than reading a page that does not exist yet. A visit left before its
pageview persisted delivers the interaction with unknown context. The verified
origin's public path is the event's `page_path`; a submission endpoint's own
label is stored separately as `route_path`. When an origin is verified its
snapshot is kept exactly, including "no attribution"; the session's newer
campaign is never substituted. The reference is believed only when that pageview exists for
this organization and the same visitor session; the event then carries that
visit's page, locale and attribution. Otherwise the context stays unknown; no
session is fabricated. Stripe outcomes carry context through the checkout,
subscription and invoice relationships.

## Querying: `query_organization_analytics`

Modes: `events` (event history), `sessions` (derived last-touch view),
`breakdown` (grouped metrics), `daily_summaries` (the retained daily summary
rows at their own grain). Inputs: `start_date`/`end_date` in the
organization's timezone, string-equality `filters` over the documented fields,
`attribution_basis` (`observed` | `event_snapshot` | `session_last_touch`),
`sort`, `limit` (1–200), `cursor`, `dimensions`, `metrics`, `outcome_event`.
Response: `rows`, `next_cursor`, the resolved `query` (including the `as_of`
boundary), `totals` with units (monetary totals by currency, never summed across
currencies), and `coverage`. Cursors are HMAC-signed and bound to the
organization, exact query, sort and `as_of`; tampered, foreign or mismatched
cursors are rejected. Distinct counts (`sessions`, `visitors`, `entities`) are
exact at the requested grain.

`session_conversion_rate` and `converting_sessions` require `outcome_event`.
The eligible population is the sessions with a pageview in the group; the
converting sessions are those same sessions that completed the outcome in the
range, so the rate cannot exceed 100%. Filters and dimensions that only outcome
events carry, and a `kind`/`event_name` other than `pageview`, are rejected
for these metrics.

`attribution_basis=session_last_touch` reads a session's last touch as of the
cursor's `as_of` boundary, not as it is now: a session no event has touched
since the boundary is read from its record, otherwise it is rebuilt from the
pageviews received by then (a session with no touch by then is Direct). A
touch that arrives between two pages therefore never moves earlier events
between groups.

`daily_summaries` (`filters.summary_kind`: `organization_day`, `page_day` or
`dimension_day`, plus `dimension`/`value`/`path_prefix`) pages completely
through the daily summaries, a derived view of the native events kept for fast
reporting. Each row carries its `summary_kind`, grain and stored metrics
(`coverage.summary_source` lists them). Nothing is reconstructed into events.
A summary rewritten after the first page makes the cursor stale and it is
rejected.

## Retention and coverage

Native analytics facts are not aged out. Pageviews, interactions, outcomes and
sessions stay in D1 for the life of the organization, so `mode=events` reads
everything KrabiClaw has collected for it, and no scheduled task deletes
`analytics_events` or session summaries. Data is deleted when the organization
itself is deleted (its rows cascade), never because it is old. Daily summaries
are caches derived from those events; they can be rebuilt from them and never
replace them. Rejecting Google Analytics consent stops the GA copy and nothing
native.

`coverage` reports the oldest native pageview and outcome/interaction, the
instrumentation dates (`observed_attribution_recorded_from` and the like), and
per range the events recorded before a fact existed, which list it under
`missing` instead of reading as zero.

## Google Analytics pageviews

A page view reaches Google Analytics only after the native pageview was
accepted. The collector sends the pageview to `/api/analytics/track` and, when
that request confirms it recorded the event, calls
`zaraz.track('krabiclaw_native_pageview', { event_id })`. The reconciled Zaraz
configuration fires the GA4 pageview action on a trigger that matches exactly
that event, and turns off Zaraz's automatic page-load and single-page-app
(`historyChange`) pageviews, so an ignored or failed native pageview sends
nothing and a navigation cannot be counted twice.

The native response grants one atomic Zaraz delivery claim. The browser awaits
the handoff and records `payload.ga4_delivery` through the collector, bound to
that event, organization, session, and claim. `dispatched` means Zaraz accepted
the call, not confirmation from Google. Rejected/absent consent and missing
destinations record their own status; a failed handoff records `failed`.
Historical rows without an audit remain unknown.

`query_organization_analytics` accepts `filters.campaign_prefix` in events,
sessions, and breakdown modes. It is a literal, case-sensitive prefix under the
selected attribution basis: a run ID matches its sub-campaigns in one query,
and `%`/`_` have no wildcard meaning. CMS session and visitor totals count
distinct identifiers on pageviews in the selected range, including historical
events recorded before session summaries existed.

## Attribution

Only a request that already carries `kc_session_id` and `kc_visitor_id` gives an
event a browser session and an immutable snapshot of that session's last-touch
attribution (source, medium, campaign, term, content, click IDs). Everything else
(Stripe webhooks, MCP, dashboard operators, scheduled work) is recorded as a
nonbrowser event with no session and no attribution; nothing mints a browser
session from server headers. The report exposes the count as
`coverage.outcomeEventsWithoutAttribution`.

Revenue is attributed without a browser session: checkout stores the visitor's
native attribution on the subscription intent
(`stripe_ga4_subscription_intents.attribution_json`, read from their `kc_session_id`
session), and the payment a webhook records later carries that snapshot
(`attributedValue`), found through the subscription and checkout kind whatever the
intent's status or expiry, so a first payment after a trial still carries it. Refunds carry their purchase's snapshot. Renewals have no
snapshot of their own; they belong to the signup cohort.

`signupCohort` groups signups by the signup event's own snapshot and follows the
organization the user originated (the first owner, recorded as
`metadata.originating_user_id` on the first onboarding or purchase event; every later
event of that organization, including refunds, reuses that recorded relationship, so
ownership changes never rewrite a result) to onboarding, first
payment and cohort revenue, counting only outcomes after the signup. It never
rewrites the later events' own attribution. `attribution` groups sessions by their
current last touch and counts, in the same group, the sessions that completed an
outcome, so its rate never exceeds 100%. `outcomeAttribution` groups outcome events
by their own snapshot and carries counts only.

## Value

Amounts are stored in minor units with an ISO currency in the event payload
(`value`) and converted to major units once, in `utils/ga4-projection.ts`.

- `quoted` (bookings): the price the guest was shown. It is `unit_amount x
  party_size` for the selected variant, resolved with `resolveVariantPrice`
  (`shared/prices.ts`) at booking creation and snapshotted; a later price edit
  never revalues it. Experience seats are priced per person, as the product page
  states. A variant with no offer has no value, not a zero. A quote is not revenue.
- `purchase`: `value` is the invoice total excluding tax (GA4 ecommerce `value`);
  `collected_minor` is `amount_paid`, tax included. Report both. Items carry each
  invoice line's exact integer total (`amount_minor`), net of its discounts, pretax
  credits and included tax; GA4's unit `price` is derived as total / quantity, so a
  line of 1,000 across three seats neither throws nor rounds. Items are kept only
  when they sum exactly to `value`; otherwise the purchase is sent without items,
  never with a balancing item.
- `refund`: keeps the purchase's basis. `value` is the refunded share of the
  tax-exclusive value (pro rata by cash, exact for a full refund) and
  `collected_minor` is the cash returned, tax included. Stripe does not itemize a
  refund, so items are sent only for a full refund; a partial refund names none.
  It is linked to the invoice (`transaction_id`) and carries the purchase's
  attribution. Every refund ID is its own event, so partial refunds stay distinct
  and a redelivery is not a second refund.

Purchases are typed `initial_subscription` (the first positive payment the
customer ever made, by payment time (`status_transitions.paid_at`, ties broken by
invoice id) rather than invoice creation order, including the first charge after a zero-value trial),
`resubscription` (a new subscription by a customer who has paid before),
`subscription_renewal`, `upgrade`, `downgrade` or `plan_change`, from Stripe's
paid-invoice history, not a shadow lifecycle. Every paid subscription invoice is a
purchase; only invoices outside the subscription lifecycle (for example manual
ones) are not. Invoice IDs are unique within the
seller's Stripe account, which is the measuring organization's namespace.

Currencies are never summed together. `net` is collected minus refunded per
currency, both including tax.

## Report definitions

- `sessionConversionRate` = sessions that completed the event / eligible sessions
  in the range (null when there are none). `events` is frequency; the two are
  different metrics.
- Signup is per user; onboarding and payment are per organization.
  `signupCohort.onboardedSignups` counts a signup as converted when a linked owned
  organization reached the outcome by `observedThrough`. `onboardedBusinesses` and
  `firstPaidBusinesses` count organizations directly and include invitation and
  existing-user journeys.
- `coverage.measurementContractStartedAt` is the first event written by this
  contract. Earlier history has no values, creative content or nonbrowser events
  and is not reconstructed.

## Google Analytics delivery

The destination is always the measuring organization's own connected property
(the `google_analytics` row of `organization_integrations`) on its canonical host. There
is no environment-level property (`GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` was removed) and no
platform Zaraz tool: KrabiClaw is configured like any tenant by
`reconcileZarazAnalytics` (`server/utils/zaraz-analytics.ts`), which deletes any GA4
tool that is not a tenant's and sets the zone's `settings.ecommerce`.

Every attempt writes its outcome to the native event (`payload.ga4_delivery`),
surfaced as `coverage.ga4Delivery`:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sent` | accepted by the transport |
| `not_configured` | no integration, no measurement ID or host, or no API secret |
| `disconnected` | the property connection is not active |
| `no_consent_context` | no visitor request, no answered consent, or no GA client ID, so consent cannot be observed |
| `consent_rejected` | the visitor's Zaraz consent cookie declines the `kc_analytics` purpose |
| `failed` | provider error (`detail` has the reason) |

Measurement Protocol (signup, onboarding and the Stripe family): the API secret
(`GA4_API_SECRET`) belongs to the platform organization's property. For signup and
onboarding the consent and GA client come from the visitor's own request: only the
Zaraz consent cookie and the `_ga` cookies are read, and a request without a
consenting visitor sends nothing and records `no_consent_context` or
`consent_rejected`. For Stripe the client ID is the one captured in the visitor's
consenting browser; it is never synthesized from a user ID. An identifier is not
consent, so it is enforced at both ends: the browser reads GA identifiers only while
the analytics purpose is accepted, `POST /api/billing/analytics-intent` stores them
only when the request's own Zaraz consent cookie says accepted, and withdrawing
consent is reconciled by `POST /api/billing/analytics-consent`: the server reads the
request's own consent cookie and, for anything but "accepted", erases the identifiers
from the signed-in user's intents and from the Stripe customer and subscription
metadata they captured (`withdrawStripeGaIdentifiers`). It runs when the choice
changes (`zarazConsentChoicesUpdated`) and whenever the authenticated dashboard
mounts, so a choice made while signed out is honored when billing resumes; the
intent endpoint also erases what an earlier acceptance left behind before it merges
metadata. Native recording never depends on consent. A `failed` Stripe
delivery fails the webhook so Stripe redelivers; the native event is already
recorded and is returned on the retry.

### GA4 property setup contract (manual, in the GA4 UI)

Sending an event is not designating it a key event. The property's read-only
Better Auth connection does not authorize edits and no code requests
`analytics.edit`. In each property that should count these:

- Key events: `sign_up`, `tutorial_complete`, `generate_lead`, `reservation_submit`,
  `booking_submit`, `purchase`.
- Event-scoped custom dimensions: `conversion_type`, `value_basis`, `purchase_type`,
  `stage`, `page_type`, `location_id`, `item_id`, `item_name`, `item_variant`.
- `value` on `booking_submit` is a quoted amount, not revenue; ecommerce revenue
  exists only on `purchase`/`refund`. Custom booking events do not populate the
  ecommerce item reports.

## Verification handoff (not done from the code session)

The code session has no GA4 property, Stripe test mode, social login or
Zaraz-enabled environment. A desktop session must verify, recording the tested
SHA:

1. Run `reconcileZarazAnalytics` against the production zone (or the designated
   qualification zone). Then verify that `ga-platform` is gone,
   `settings.ecommerce` is true, and both `Product Viewed` and `Checkout Started`
   ecommerce events reach GA4 with the documented mapping.
2. Consent: accept, pay, then withdraw and confirm the stored identifiers are gone and later payments/refunds record natively with delivery `no_consent_context`. Password and social signup, real onboarding, Stripe test payment, first
   payment after a trial, renewal and a partial refund produce the events in the
   table above and the `ga4_delivery` outcomes, in the designated GA4 property
   (DebugView plus a standard report). Validate the Measurement Protocol payload
   with Google's validation server, then confirm collection.
3. `ZARAZ_ANALYTICS=absent` environments never reconcile the zone, so they are not
   evidence of production Zaraz behavior (browser events, ecommerce).
4. Read the same range through the authenticated dashboard API, MCP
   `get_organization_analytics` and CMS Insights and compare fields.
5. Multi-organization isolation: platform subscription revenue on KrabiClaw only,
   tenant booking outcomes on the tenant only.

## Measurement never masks a committed result

`POST /api/public/contact`, `/api/public/reservations` and
`/api/public/products/:slug/book` commit the business record first. Measurement
is recorded after, and its outcome is returned beside the committed identity as
`measurement: { status: 'recorded' }` or `{ status: 'failed', reason }`; it never
turns a confirmed submission into an error the guest would retry.
