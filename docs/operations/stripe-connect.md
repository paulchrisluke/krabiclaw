# Stripe Connect onboarding

KrabiClaw creates one Stripe Accounts v2 merchant account per Better Auth
organization. The account uses Stripe's full dashboard and Stripe-hosted
onboarding. Stripe collects and stores verification data; KrabiClaw stores only
the Stripe account ID, capability status, normalized requirements, country, and
mode.

This integration uses the repository's existing Stripe SDK and pinned API
version. Do not add a second Stripe client or override the API version.

## Stripe configuration

Create a thin-event destination for each environment with this endpoint:

```text
https://<environment-host>/api/stripe/connect/webhook
```

Subscribe it to:

- `v2.core.account.updated`
- `v2.core.account[configuration.merchant].capability_status_updated`
- `v2.core.account[configuration.merchant].updated`
- `v2.core.account[identity].updated`
- `v2.core.account[requirements].updated`
- `v2.core.account_link.returned`

Store that destination's signing secret as `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
It is deliberately separate from `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, which belongs to the
Better Auth platform-billing webhook.

The Stripe key must be able to create and retrieve Accounts v2, create Account
Links v2, retrieve Events v2, and list Country Specs. Keep test and live
destinations, keys, and signing secrets paired with their matching environment.

## Release order

Follow [release-flow.md](release-flow.md) and
[release-and-outage-prevention.md](release-and-outage-prevention.md). The
generated D1 migration must land before code that reads
`stripe_connected_accounts` or `stripe_webhook_events.processor`. Never hand
write or hand-apply that migration.

Before enabling onboarding in an environment:

1. Add `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` as a Cloudflare Worker secret.
2. Apply the reviewed generated migration through the canonical release flow.
3. Deploy the Worker.
4. Complete onboarding for a disposable organization and confirm the dashboard
   moves from action required or pending review to ready when Stripe activates
   `card_payments`.
5. Confirm the matching `connect_marketplace` event reaches `processed` in
   `stripe_webhook_events`; inspect failures through the existing dead-letter
   tooling.

## D1 behavior and limitations

D1 has no Postgres advisory locks or transactional outbox. Account creation is
therefore guarded by an organization-unique reservation plus a stable Stripe
idempotency key. Webhook work uses conditional D1 lease claims, bounded retries,
and the existing dead-letter/operator-requeue contract. Stripe remains the
source of truth, so dashboard refreshes retrieve the account again instead of
inferring readiness from the return redirect.

The country and live/test mode are immutable after reservation. A mismatch is a
conflict, not a fallback. Account Links are single-use and short-lived, so every
start or refresh request creates a new link and never stores its URL.
