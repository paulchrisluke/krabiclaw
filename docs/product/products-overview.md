# Products overview

The approved v3 visual is implemented by Krabiclaw's published page document at
`/products`. Migration `0002_products_overview.sql` retains the former Features
document identity and replaces its blocks. Platform `/features` links redirect
permanently to `/products`, preserving query parameters. Customer catalog routes
continue to use their existing product presentation.

The page uses the existing `products` recipe and canonical typed blocks: `hero`,
`button_group`, `media_text`, `workflow_grid`, `feature_grid`, and `cta`. The
platform template gives this recipe its editorial presentation. Buttons use
`PlatformAccountCta` and the shared platform button styles.

Future product detail pages are ordinary platform page documents at
`/products/:slug`, served by the existing catch-all route. Set their recipe to
`products` and compose the same blocks; no product-specific Vue component or
route is required. A `media_text` block can use its normal `media` placement for
one image, or `items.<index>.image` placements for multiple examples. Example
type distinguishes website examples from photos/posts. Titles, descriptions,
captions, links, and image alternatives remain authored content. No detail
documents are published by this change.

Images under `public/images/products` are supplied source assets from the
owner-approved reference package. Their canonical media records use the static
provider because the files ship with the Worker. The NCLS image is solely a
website example; it makes no claim about AI usage. The social images are real
published examples and make no claim of automatic synchronization.

Canonical metadata, JSON-LD, localization, sitemap discovery, and public resource
cache invalidation remain in the existing page-document pipeline. No preview
environment switch or external media publication is required.

## Approved artwork revision

On 2026-10-01 the owner approved two distinct replacement scenes: an elevated
archipelago for `products-hero` / `media`, and a moonlit shore for
`products-closing` / `media`. Both masters are 1672×941. Files are preserved
without redrawing or resizing. Hero and closing use separate asset identities.
Desktop uses centered bottom cropping; mobile uses 58% for the hero and 92% for
the closing image to retain its moon and lantern path. Both use `object-fit: cover`.
Keep text regions quiet in the upper center; mobile crops most of the sides.

Updated transfer package SHA-256:
`90624c8c40c9697577da7fba8c5f22a1f98385605e7939b760b44f2a79a78358`.

Product detail routes have a reusable renderer, but no authored detail documents
are published. Section links use existing published destinations. Inbox,
publishing and analytics links point to their relevant guides; the local-presence
link explicitly identifies the guide to business locations and hours. They do
not imply unpublished product-detail content or a new reviews guide.
