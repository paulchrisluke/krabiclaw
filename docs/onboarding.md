# Onboarding

## Principle

Global first, local second, persistent after that.

- **Site/org level** (once per site): brand, currency, timezone default, team, ChatGPT app, core offering. Social profiles are the accounts connected in Integrations.
- **Location level** (once per location, repeats on every new location): hours, contact, notification destination, location hero/media, location-specific copy.
- Onboarding is not a single linear flow that ends at "Create site." It collects the first handful of critical steps; everything else is done from the dashboard after the site exists. The flow itself loads no checklist; `server/utils/onboarding-checklist.ts` feeds the organization analytics report only.

## Current flow

The flow is draft-first, and this is the one and only new-site creation path:

One screen per question, one question per URL, under `/dashboard/onboarding`: `type → business → location → contact → hours → [products] → look → review`. `ONBOARDING_STEPS` in `composables/useOnboardingFlow.ts` is the only place that order is written down — Back, Next, the skipped steps and where a resumed draft lands all read it. `composables/useOnboardingDraft.ts` owns every server call; the step screens own presentation and nothing else.

- The `business` step is one search, `lib/components/workspace/location/GooglePlacePicker.vue`, the same picker add-location and Settings → Integrations → Google Maps use. It calls Places API (New) Autocomplete through `POST /api/dashboard/google-places/autocomplete` and, for the chosen prediction, Place Details through `POST /api/dashboard/google-places/details`, both with one client-generated session token that the Details call ends; the API key stays on the server. Picking a prediction is the confirmation: it records the `placeId` and seeds the location, contact and hours screens, which stay editable. "Enter details manually", under the predictions, keeps the typed name instead. No surface accepts a Google Maps link.
- The first save, on leaving the location step, creates the active draft through `POST /api/dashboard/onboarding/drafts/active`: a manual draft, or a Google Places draft carrying only the `placeId`, for which the server fetches the full Place Details, reviews included. That same first save also provisions the **real tenant**, pending, as a new organization named after the brand, through the same `provisionOrganization()` the only other entry point uses, `POST /api/organizations`, with `activate: false`. Both pass the target organization explicitly — `/dashboard/onboarding` is the "New Organization" entry point, so a draft never carries one and the first save creates it and records it on the draft; `POST /api/organizations` takes the organization from the dashboard route's `org` query or an explicit `organizationId`.
- Every following save re-applies the whole draft to that site through `applyOnboardingDraftToSite()`, which is a full rebuild and idempotent. The preview pane frames the site itself, on its own subdomain, carrying the site's preview token — there is no separate draft renderer. The site's address is claimed at the first save and does not change if the brand name does.
- `activate()` makes it public via `POST /api/dashboard/onboarding/drafts/[draftId]/activate`: it re-applies the draft, flips `onboarding_status` to `active`, makes the organization the session's active one, and closes the draft. Abandoning the draft removes the pending site through `DELETE /api/dashboard/onboarding/drafts/active` (see [Deleting a tenant](#deleting-a-tenant)).
- Adding a location to an *existing* organization walks the same step table, as the `add-location` flow: a strict subset — `business → location → contact → hours → review`, with no business type, no brand and no activation, because the organization already has all three. It is not routed; `pages/dashboard/[orgSlug]/locations/new.vue` is the whole walk and holds the current step itself. It writes nothing until the last step, and creates exclusively through `POST /api/dashboard/locations`, which takes either the picked `placeId` (fetching Place Details and importing its reviews) or a typed `name`.

## Content state model

Generated placeholder rows are no longer part of onboarding or site creation. Tenant pages, menu items, and media are either owner/imported records or absent. Missing content is omitted or returned as an explicit empty/error state.

## Step inventory

### Site-level (once per site)

| # | Step | Required | Lands on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Business basics (Google Maps search or manual: name, vertical, address, contact) | Required | `/dashboard/onboarding` |
| 2 | Site preview (the pending site on its own subdomain, preview token) | Alongside every step, in the preview pane | `https://<subdomain>/` |
| 3 | Brand and homepage hero — colour, logo, photo, headline, description | Optional (skippable) | `/dashboard/onboarding/look` |
| 4 | Operations — timezone, notification phone | Required | `/dashboard/onboarding/hours` |
| 5 | Core offering — menu (restaurant), experiences (experience vertical); professional-service offerings | Optional here, deep-linkable to the dashboard CMS later | `/dashboard/onboarding/products` |
| 7 | Story — about, founder story, FAQ seeds | Optional | Dashboard CMS |
| 8 | Channels — Facebook/Instagram, ChatGPT app install, ChowBot intro | Optional | Dashboard (not part of the onboarding flow) |
| 9 | Team — invite admins/editors | Optional, explicitly skippable | Dashboard settings |
| 10 | Launch readiness — domain, final review, publish | Required to go live, not required to keep working in draft | `/dashboard/[orgSlug]/settings/website/domains` |

### Location-level (once per location, including the first)

Only asked again on **add-location** (the `add-location` flow), which never re-collects site-level brand/ops:

- Location title, address, hours, phone
- Notification routing for this location
- Location hero/media (uses location media only; it remains empty until supplied)
- Optional location-specific notes

## Deleting a tenant

Onboarding creates the site before the owner has finished answering, so leaving
the flow leaves a pending site holding a subdomain. Abandoning the draft through
`DELETE /api/dashboard/onboarding/drafts/active` removes it at once. Owners
delete a live workspace from Site settings → Delete workspace, and their account
from Account → Delete account; both are Better Auth's own delete endpoints and
take effect immediately. Every path runs `cleanupOrganizationBeforeDelete` in
`server/utils/tenant-deletion.ts` first, which releases the Cloudflare custom
hostnames and the Cloudflare Images the organization is the last holder of.
Better Auth then deletes the organization, and D1's `ON DELETE CASCADE` takes
the domains, locations, content, bookings, reservations, integration
selections, media and the onboarding draft that created the site with it, so
signing up again starts a new draft rather than resuming the deleted site. The
user's linked provider accounts belong to the user, not the organization, and
remain.
