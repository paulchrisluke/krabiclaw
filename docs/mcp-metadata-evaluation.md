# MCP metadata evaluation corpus

This corpus covers all 112 retained public tools for the resubmission work in
#1302. It is internal coverage, separate from the five positive and three
negative portal scenarios. **Live ChatGPT selection checks are pending.** A
catalog check or annotation unit test does not establish host selection behavior.

Run each prompt in a fresh conversation against the refreshed submitted endpoint
and prepared reviewer records. The business, location, record and permitted
operation must already be clear from the fixture/context; use discovery reads
where needed. Supply the real attached file through ChatGPT for attachment cases.
Use separate disposable records for destructive cases and guest-delivery tests.

For each row, run the direct and indirect prompts independently. Verify that the
named operation is selected with the correct business, record, fields and scope,
and read the result through its customer-facing or dashboard boundary. Record the
commit, endpoint, catalog fingerprint, prompt, selected tools, arguments, observed
result and any failed selection. A nearby negative prompt must not trigger that
row's inappropriate write or misrepresent a read as the requested write; allowed
discovery reads are not failures. Do not mark a financial handoff complete, create
unpaid substitutes, or publish to an unrequested social audience.

For booking writes, inspect guest email/inbox delivery and retries as well as
status and capacity. For proposed changes, verify that the original record stays
unchanged until guest acceptance, and that acceptance applies once. For product
patches, read back every sibling variant, price and option identity. For publication,
open the returned website/provider URL and verify only requested destinations.
For financial negative cases, compare the relevant booking, payment, hold,
Checkout, authorization and refund state before and after identical retries.

This table contains prepared prompts and expected boundaries only. Record live
results with the [resubmission evidence checklist](chatgpt-resubmission.md) after
refreshing the ChatGPT connection. Note failed checks in the written evidence,
fix the bug and repeat the independent case. Failed video takes may be discarded;
the walkthrough should show the verified successful run.
