 * client navigation Vue reports it and keeps rendering whatever was underneath,
 * which is how a missing section came to paint itself as a divider. `showError`
 * is what reaches the error page on the client, and on the server it only
 * reaches the payload — answering HTTP 200 with the error page drawn after
 * hydration. Each environment is given the one that answers.
 *
 * It returns the error it raised, so page setup — where nothing after a 404
 * should run — can `throw showNotFound()`: the error page is already up by then.
