/**
 * An article belongs to a collection. Every site has a blog; KrabiClaw's own
 * site (the platform template) also publishes documentation. Both collections
 * share the article model, the editor, the renderer, the feeds and the
 * markdown mirror; the collection decides the URL prefix and nothing else.
 *
 * Both used to file articles under a fixed list of category labels written in
 * code, and to put the matching slug in the URL. Neither list was a hierarchy:
 * `/docs/{category}` only ever resolved when some article's slug happened to
 * equal the category slug, and four of documentation's six declared categories
 * held no article at all. What the list did do was make the category a
 * required field an author could not add to — and, because an article filed
 * under an undeclared category had no URL, drop it from every index silently.
 *
 * A category is now the author's own word on both, used to group an index.
