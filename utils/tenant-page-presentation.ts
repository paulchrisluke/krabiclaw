// Which component a template draws a block with.
//
// A page is an ordered list of typed blocks. The block says what the content
// *is* — a hero, a feature grid, a question set — and the template says how it
// looks. Saya's hero, Blawby's hero and Krabiclaw's hero are three renderings
// of one block, and nothing in the document chooses between them: the site's
// template does, because that is what a template is for.
//
// So the key is the template and the block type, and nothing else. There is no
// third axis and no field in `data` naming a presentation. Content that carries
// rendering instructions is content deciding how the theme looks, which is the
// coupling this replaces: `data.section` held values like `comparison-against`
// and `proof-card` — component names, written into the document, because the
// components were built first and the data was shaped to fit them.
//
// Absence of an entry means the renderer's own markup, which is Saya's.

// The components themselves, not their names: `<component :is>` resolves a

// are imported rather than loaded on demand, because an async component whose
// import fails renders nothing at all and says nothing about why.
// Every entry is handed the block and the page by `TenantPageRenderer`, through
// a dynamic `<component :is>` that checks nothing. Typing the map as bare
// `Component` checked nothing either, which is how `BlawbyShieldDivider` kept
// declaring a `variant` prop for seven weeks after the dispatcher that passed
// it was deleted: it compiled, and rendered the wrong colour. The contract is
// the map's value type, so a component that does not take a block and a page
// fails `typecheck` rather than a customer's eye.
