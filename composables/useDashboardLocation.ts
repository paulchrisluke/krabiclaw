// and `selectLocation`. Nothing consumed any of them — every caller takes the
// composable whole and reads only the three below. The path builder among them
// fell back to `?? locationIdOrSlug` when a lookup missed, so an unknown id
// produced a real-looking URL to a location that does not exist, while
// `selectLocation` right beside it fast-failed on the same lookup. Two answers to
// one question, neither reachable.
