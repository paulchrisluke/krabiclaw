/**
 * Page-level controls in the dashboard header, beside the account avatar.
 *
 * A page cannot fill a slot on the header: the layout renders the header and
 * <NuxtPage> as siblings, so there is no parent-child line to pass one down.
 * A page registers here instead and the header renders what is registered,
 * which keeps the control's state and handler with the page that owns them.
 *
 * Registration is keyed and client-only. Keyed, because two pages briefly
 * overlap during a route change and an unkeyed list renders both — the second
 * registration of a key replaces the first rather than sitting next to it.
 * Client-only, because this module's state is shared by every request on the
 * server; the header renders it inside <ClientOnly> for the same reason.
