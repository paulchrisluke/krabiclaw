/*
  An index: a level whose rows link to its children. It is the whole screen
  with nothing open, the left column once a child is, and it steps aside when a
  grandchild owns both columns — Nuxt UI's own two-panel idiom, decided here
  from the route tree so no page carries a breakpoint.

  Pairing and auto-selection are separate. Beside its parent the index is a
  column because the route tree nests it there, whatever its rows are.
  `autoOpen` only answers whether it may choose one of its own children on
  arrival: an index of deterministic settings or fields names its first one, the
  way a listing editor lands on its first section; a list of records names none.
  Below the pane width the index is the screen and nothing is chosen for the
  tenant. `replace`, so Back still leaves the index. A level in a mode named by
  its URL's `editMode`, such as its translations, is that mode's screen, and
  choosing a child would leave the mode; it opens one when the mode closes.
