  A leaf: one thing, its own column, Cancel and Save in the panel's footer —
  Airbnb's editor-leaf shape, and on a phone the sheet that covers the list it
  came from. Every leaf in the dashboard is this component with a field in the
  slot, so the header, the loading state, the error and the footer are written
  once rather than re-drawn per screen.

  Cancel is the leaf's own Back: a push to the level that contains it, which is
  the route record above this one.

  Beside its index — two columns, `lg` — the leaf has no Close and no Cancel:
  the index's Back is the way out and Save is the only control, which is what
  Airbnb's editor does at its two-column width (measured 2026-09-21). Both
  exist only where the leaf is a sheet covering the list it came from.
